# Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey scripts

These scripts can be copy/pasted into the Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome) extension.

## Scripts
* duck-duck-go-to-google.js - show a `GOOGLE IT` link in the DDG navbar, in case you're unsatisfied with DDG's search results. I use DDG as my default search engine, but bail out to Google ~25% of the time. This saves me lots of time.
